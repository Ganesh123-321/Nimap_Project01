# Nimap_Project01
This project was created as part of a machine test assigned by Nimap Infotech. It demonstrates the implementation of CRUD operations using Java with the following requirements:

Spring Boot
A lightweight framework to build and run the application efficiently.
REST Controller
Handles HTTP requests and maps them to appropriate service methods.
Relational Database (RDB) Configuration
Integrated with a relational database instead of an in-memory database for persistent data storage.
Annotation-Based Configuration
Eliminates the need for XML configurations by using annotations for dependency injection and configuration.
JPA & Hibernate
Utilized for ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to manage database operations seamlessly.
